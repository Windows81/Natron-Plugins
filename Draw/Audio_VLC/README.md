# For Windows users:

You have to set the VLC environment path in Windows. To do this there are two `.bat` files in the folder `Audio_VLC`, they will set the path for you. If you are using a 32-bit VLC, then run the x86 one. If you are using a 64-bit VLC, then run the x64 one. File paths with accented characters do not currently work.
